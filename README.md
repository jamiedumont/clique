An (unfinished) Statamic theme for creating membership sites.

## What is this?
For a time, I made some themes for Statamic to sell on their marketplace. I released a couple (one free, another paid) but found that the sales didn't match up to the time invested on each theme.

I decided to focus my attention on the work that I enjoy (custom applications with Elixir) and the problem I wanted to solve (a Crossfit app that properly tracked an athletes progress). That meant stepping back from my client work (with Statamic), the theme building and the tutorials that I used to publish on my blog.

I'm opening up all my private repos in the hope that someone might find them useful, even if (like this one) the sites aren't complete.
